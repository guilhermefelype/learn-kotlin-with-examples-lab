# Learn Kotlin with Examples: Project Challenge (Lab)

This project challenge was created to evaluate the technical content explored in the repository [learn-kotlin-with-examples](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/aprenda-kotlin-com-exemplos). **In this context, we will abstract the following application domain:**

**[DIO](https://web.dio.me) offers incredible `Trainings` aimed at providing a set of `EducationalContents` focused on a specific technology stack, preparing IT professionals for the job market. `Trainings` have some important characteristics such as `name`, `level`, and their respective `educationalContents`. Additionally, these educational experiences have a relevant behavior in our domain, defined by the ability to `enroll` one or more `Students`.**

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Kotlin application that models a training system. The main features include:

- **Registering Trainings**: Create and manage training programs with specific names and levels.
- **Enrolling Students**: Enroll users into trainings.
- **Managing Content**: Add and remove educational content from trainings.
- **Listing Information**: Display details of trainings, enrolled students, and contents.

## Features

- **Show Complete Training**: Display all details of a specific training, including its level, contents, and enrolled students.
- **Enroll Users**: Add new users to a training program.
- **Unenroll Users**: Remove users from a training program.
- **Show Students**: List all students enrolled in a specific training.
- **Add Content**: Add new educational content to a training program.
- **Remove Content**: Remove educational content from a training program.
- **Show Contents**: List all contents of a specific training.
- **Register New Training**: Create and register a new training program.
- **Remove Training**: Delete an existing training program.
- **List Trainings**: List all available training programs.

## Usage

To run the application, ensure you have Kotlin installed and execute the `main` function in the `Main.kt` file. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the training system.

## Example

Here is an example of how the application might be used:

1. **Register a new training**:
   - Enter the name of the training and its level.
   - Example: "Kotlin Basics", Level: BASIC

2. **Enroll a user**:
   - Enter the training name, user's name, and email.
   - Example: Training: "Kotlin Basics", User: "John Doe", Email: "john.doe@example.com"

3. **Add educational content**:
   - Enter the training name, content name, duration, and level.
   - Example: Training: "Kotlin Basics", Content: "Introduction to Kotlin", Duration: 120 minutes, Level: BASIC

By following these steps, you can easily manage and interact with the training system, ensuring an engaging learning experience for all participants.
